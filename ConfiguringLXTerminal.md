# Configuring the LXTerminal #

Before you can commit and push, you need to tell the terminal who you are on GitHub. That requires the following two commands:

`git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"`

YOUR NAME will change depending on your name. It doesn't have to be your GitHub username, just your name.

`git config --global user.email "YOUR GITHUB EMAIL"`

YOUR GITHUB EMAIL will be the email you used when you signed up for a GitHub account.

When you push, you will still be asked for your GitHub username and password.
