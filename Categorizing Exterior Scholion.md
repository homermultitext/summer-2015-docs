Similar to the interlinear scholion, many of the exterior scholia reproduce words from the main Iliad text  for a variety of reasons:

- Multiform1 (A multiform unique to the exterior scholion)
- Multiform2 (A multiform discussed in a different scholion, such that the exterior scholion serves as the arbiter)
- Comment (Self Explanatory)
- Inscrutable (When you just can't)
- ScribalProcesing? (Resolution of some editing error, not a multiform per se) (urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5206.msAext.hmt:18.8)

Like the interlinear, when the scholion consists of a strict multiform without any language indicating a source (such as ἐν ἀλλῷ, παρά Ζηνοδότῳ, etc.)then no 'q' element should be applied.
