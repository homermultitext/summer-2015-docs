Similar to the interlinear scholion, many of the exterior scholia reproduce words from the main Iliad text  for a variety of reasons:

- Multiform1 (A multiform unique to the exterior scholion)
- Multiform2 (A multiform discussed in a different scholion, such that the exterior scholion serves as the arbiter)
- Comment (Self Explanatory)
- Inscrutable (When you just can't)
- ScribalProcesing? (Resolution of some editing error, not a multiform per se) (urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5206.msAext.hmt:18.8)

Like the interlinear, when the scholion consists of a strict multiform without any language indicating a source (such as ἐν ἀλλῷ, παρά Ζηνοδότῳ, etc.)then no 'q' element should be applied.


Also, in general, when the scribe makes a mistake when quoting, one must first place the 'q' element around the word or words being quoted, and then within the 'q' element place the 'sic' tag around the individual word which was written next to it. This applies to more than just a misspelling which results in an unparseable form (ἐλίσσοντο misspelled as λλίσσοντο; urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:18.448), but also for instances when the misspelling results in a parseable string. In this instance, one must be sure the scribe is not presenting a multiform, but is clearly trying to reference the Iliad lines but failed to recreate it faithfully. (eg, ὥς misspelled as ὅς).

Finally, when a quoted string is deleted by the scribe, the 'q' element falls within the 'del' element.
