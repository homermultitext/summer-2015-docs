# Indexing the Scholia #

1. In your github repository go to the 'Collections' folder. Pick the correct file for the type of scholia you are indexing (main, interior, exterior, intermarginal, or interlinear).
2. Take a moment to notice the difference in the text URNs for the different scholia documents. They are as follows:

| Siglum | Scholia Document |
|:---:|:---:|
| msA | main scholia |
| msAim | intermarginal scholia |
| msAint | interior scholia |
| msAext |  exterior scholia |
| msAil | interlinear scholia |

3. These files have three columns: one for the text URN, one for the image URN, and one for the folio object URN
4. The text URN refers to the scholion as a text document. Unlike the main text, these do not have cannonical citations. You will be creating them. They should have completely unique URNs, so the numbers at the end should change. It is easiest to go up sequentially. If there are multiple groups at work, you may want to assign each group a letter (so you can do A1, A2, B1, B2, etc).

    e.g. urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.hmt:18.1 (refers to the first main scholion in Book 18 of the Venetus A)

5. The image URNs are generated via the image citation tool. You may want to have a zoomable image browser up at the same time so that you draw your region of interest at the right point. You may also want to reference the text editions of the scholia in Dindorf and/or Erbse to help you distinguish where scholia start and end. Dindorf has a record of the interlinear scholia at the end of his second volume.
6. Finally the folio URN is an object URN refering to the folio. It is NOT an image URN. These URNs will look something like this:

    urn:cite:hmt:msA.12r

7. Remember when you start a new folio to keep moving sequentially through your scholia text URN references. You should not repeat any identifiers. THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!
