# Indexing the Main Text #

1. In your github repository, go to the 'indices' folder and open the '...textToImage-Iliad.csv' file.
2. This file has two columns, one for Text URNs and one for Image URNs.
3. Select the edit button (top right corner, looks like a pencil).
4. Your text URNs should correspond to the Iliadic line you are indexing. Remember that this is a version specific urn, so there should be some reference for the manuscript you are working in.

    e.g. urn:cts:greekLit.tlg0012.tlg001.msA:18.1 (refers to *Iliad* 18.1 in the Venetus A)

5. Using the image citation tool, create a region of interest (draw a box) around the relevant line and copy the URN it generates into the table. You can find the ICT when you search an image and click the "Cite & Quote Image" option below the thumbnail. You can search for images [here](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/).
6. Be sure to verify that you are using the correct line references by checking with an edition of the *Iliad*.
